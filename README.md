# Player Churn Prediction in Gaming Platform using Machine Learning

## Overview
In today's competitive gaming landscape, player churn poses a significant challenge for gaming platforms seeking to maintain user engagement and sustain business growth. Understanding and predicting player churn is crucial for devising effective retention strategies and optimizing user experience.
This repository contains the code and data used for a project focused on predicting player churn in the gaming industry using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm and Logistic Regression . The aim of the project is to develop a predictive model that identifies players who are at risk of leaving the game. The analysis is supported by Power BI insights for better visualization and understanding of churn factors.

## Key Features
- Predictive Modeling: Utilizes machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest, to predict player churn based on various gameplay and engagement metrics.
- Data Analysis: Analyzes player demographics, in-game purchases, social interactions, and historical gaming behaviors to identify critical factors influencing player attrition.
- Power BI Integration: Provides visual insights into player behavior and churn prediction using Power BI dashboards, enhancing the understanding of the factors contributing to churn.
